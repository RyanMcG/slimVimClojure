- add debugger (SLDB) (how?)
- add some kind of Complete-Form (it can probably not read back arglist, so maybe use hyperspec instead)
- use maplocalleader instead of mapleader
- allow switch on/off each hyperspec symbol db
- eliminate identical lines from command history
- display lisp startup text
- separate variables for wanting to open repl and repl actually opened
- refresh do not open repl in .lisp window
- paredit mode into separate script
- paredit map for X, D, C, <n>dd, s, S
- connect to remote Lisp
- refactoring tool (like in Slime)
