- add debugger (SLDB) (how?)
- add some kind of Complete-Form (it can probably not read back arglist, so maybe use hyperspec instead)
- use maplocalleader instead of mapleader
- have different g:slimv_lisp variables for Lisp and Clojure
- allow switch on/off each hyperspec symbol db
- initialize hyperspec symbol db only at first lookup
- eliminate identical lines from command history
- display lisp startup text
- separate variables for wanting to open repl and repl actually opened
- refresh do not open repl in .lisp window
