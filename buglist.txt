I've run into one problem, though (and I have no idea how to solve it):
I have a local copy of CLHS, so I would use
let g:slimv_clhs_root="file:/usr/share/doc/hyperspec/Body/"
but which produces strange errors when I specify my own browser; so I need to
use
let g:slimv_clhs_root="file:///usr/share/doc/hyperspec/Body/"
instead.
"Unable to retrieve file:///share/doc/hyperspec/Body/m_defun.htm:
No such file or directory" is what elinks displays.
It's because 'file://' specifies the protocol, I think; the third '/' marks an
absolute path (the following rest).

The omni-completion behaves strange on my system, I have supertab
(http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1643) installed on my system,
so I can use <Tab> for omni completion. But it just doesn't work with your
plugin. I have to type <C-X><C-O> to trigger 'Omni completion', pressing <Tab>
just triggers 'Keyword completion' (which displays tags from my
ctags generated tag file). Hopy you can help me out with that one, too.
Supertab is configured to behave in context and ":set onmifunc?" displays
"omnifunc=SlimvComplete".

But, TBH I've disabled some of the keybindings; I always seem to get into some kind of
problem with unbalanced " and ).

The problem seems to be that "cw" and similar happily delete the " at the end of a word
- so the " get unbalanced, and trying to insert one just lets the cursor jump to the
next " (which may be some lines away, and is certainly the wrong one).

Furthermore I'm a bit disturbed when I'm changing a bit of text, like with ct"NEW TEXT"
(change to ", new text, and final ") - and when trying to repeat that at another
position nothing happens, because the final " when out of insert mode and so the repeat
register is empty.

I'm not sure what's the right solution here; getting the parenthesis balanced is fine by
itself, but there are some conflicting interactions with the way I'm editing.

I use this (dirty) patch, together with a line

 noremap ,,  m'vap:<C-U>call SlimvEvalRegionJ("'")<CR>

so that when I evaluate something the cursor is in the same location as
it was on the ",," keypress (when returning to that window, that is.)

Well, my solution was to set the ' mark.
Maybe it would be better to just store the current cursor position and jump back there -
but it works.

If you get a neater solution I'd be happy to use it.

And another bug report: Pressing Ctrl+D in the REPL buffer (both in
normal mode and insert mode) does not quit the SBCL
instance. To do that, I have to write (quit), press enter and then
press enter again in the Slimv REPL window (outside of vim).

Furthermore I saw that it sometimes puts the whitespace in wrong places;
like above, the space after the opening parenthesis, or two spaces
["(a) b" => "(a  b)"].
Maybe you could fix these things.
