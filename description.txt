Description
Slimv tries to mimic a subset of Emacs with SLIME inside Vim. The script defines functions and keybindings to send Lisp s-expressions to a Lisp REPL. Slimv runs its own REPL or connects to a running REPL started by a previous Slimv session. The connection to the Lisp REPL is established when the first Slimv command is executed (e.g. an s-expression is evaluated).

Here follows a list of Slimv commands, for a more complete description with keybindings see the included documentation.

Connection commands:
    *  Connect to Server

Evaluation commands:
    *  Eval Defun
    *  Eval Last Expression
    *  Pprint Eval Last Expression
    *  Eval Region
    *  Eval Buffer
    *  Interactive Eval
    *  Undefine Function

Debug commands:
    *  Macroexpand-1
    *  Macroexpand
    *  Trace
    *  Untrace
    *  Disassemble
    *  Inspect

Compile commands:
    *  Compile Defun
    *  Compile and Load File
    *  Compile File
    *  Compile Region

Profile commands:
    *  Profile
    *  Unprofile

Documentation commands:
    *  Describe Symbol
    *  Apropos 

Place the cursor at any location inside an s-expression or on a name of a symbol then invoke a Slimv command in order to send the command operated on the given expression or symbol to the running Lisp.

For more information see the documentation coupled with the script.
 
Installation details
Extract the zip archive into your vimfiles or runtime directory. The archive contains plugin/slimv.vim, plugin/slimv.py and doc/slimv.txt.
Slimv requires Lisp and Python installed on your system. Slimv tries to autodetect your Lisp and Python installation directories. If it fails to determine the correct directories, then you need to enter path definitions into your vimrc file.

See the included documentation for complete installation and customization instructions.
