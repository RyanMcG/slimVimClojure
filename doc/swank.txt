INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION                             *swank-installation*

Installation:

  - Vim 7.0 or newer installed with Python feature enabled.
    This can be verified by the :ver command, look for the +python string.
    It is recommended to have also the +balloon_eval feature for displaying
    symbol descriptions in tooltip.
  - Python installed.
    Must be the same Python version that was Vim compiled against.
    This can also be verified by the :ver command, look for the
    -DDYNAMIC_PYTHON_DLL=\"pythonXX\" string, where XX is the required
    Python version.
  - Lisp or Clojure installed.
    Any Lisp implementation is OK that has SLIME support.
  - SWANK server installed.
    This can be a standalone SWANK installation (like swank-clojure),
    or as part of Emacs with SLIME, or Leiningen (lein swank).
